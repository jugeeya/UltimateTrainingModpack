# Features
The features in this modpack are configured through the menu, which can be accessed within training mode by pressing `SPECIAL+UPTAUNT`. Generally they fall into these categories:

- Enables or disables stage hazards
- Saves and loads the positional state of the player and CPU
- Displays additional information onscreen
- Controls CPU behavior

## Stage Hazards

Set stage hazards on or off in Training Mode! Use this to practice on tournament legal stages with hazards.


## Save States

At any time in Training Mode, you can press `Grab + Down Taunt` to save the state of training mode. This will save the position, state, and damage of each fighter, which can then be reverted to at any time with `Grab + Up Taunt`. With the mirroring setting,loading the save state will flip the positions, allowing you to practice your skills facing both directions. Use this instead of the built-in training mode reset!

## Input Delay

Practice with emulated extra input delay, in frames. Use this to practice with online's default delay.

## Frame Advantage

Practice moves on shield to find out the frame advantage of the moves performed. Best used with Infinite Shield. Can also be used to find the advantage on hit to determine appropriate followups.

## Hitbox Visualization
Currently, hitboxes and grabboxes are supported. When visualization is active, other move effects are temporarily turned off for easier visualization.

## CPU Behavior

The CPU can be instructed to perform a wide array of different actions in response to particular situations. The following situations are available:

- Mash: To be performed after being hit or shielding an attack
- Followup: To be performed as soon as possible after the mash option
- Ledge: To be performed when hanging on the ledge
- Tech: To be performed when slammed into the ground or wall
- Miss Tech: To be performed after failing to tech
- Defensive: To be performed after the ledge, tech, or miss tech option

The timing of the CPU option can be influenced by the following settings:

- Aerial Delay
- Ledge Delay
- OoS Offset
- Reaction Time
- Fast Fall Delay
- Falling Aerials
- Mash in Neutral

-----

## Menu Settings

When multiple options are selected, one of the selected options will be chosen at random. Open / focused menus can be reset by pressing the `X` button. All menus can be reset to the default by pressing the `L` button.

# Installation

To install the training modpack, download the .zip file from the [latest release page](https://github.com/jugeeya/UltimateTrainingModpack/releases/latest). Extract the files from the .zip file using the file explorer on Windows or Mac, or a program such as 7-zip (windows) or unzip (Linux). Then transfer the extracted contents onto the root of your SD card, merging the /atmosphere folder with the one on your SD card. No files need to be deleted when upgrading from a previous version. The SD card should have the below files at these locations.

# Frequently Asked Questions

* Can my Switch run the Training Modpack?
    * Your switch has to be hackable, which means it needs to be an early enough unit. You can check at https://ismyswitchpatched.com/ .
* Is this mod wifi-safe?
    * Yes*. Smash online is client sided. What this means is when playing against an opponent, their instance of the game is separate from your instance of the game, and when the server sends over data from the other player, it is replicated on your screen. Desyncs arise from when properties from the other side differ from what your game expects. (For example, Mario’s Forward Smash dealing 95% instead of its’ normal amount of damage). Because Training Modpack is only available while using Training Mode, the training modpack is safe to use while using online games. However, you should recognize that mods are not sanctioned by Nintendo and that there is always some ban risk associated with using them. Use this mod and others at your own risk.
* Is this mod compatible with Yuzu or other emulators?
    * No, emulators do not support Skyline yet, which is the code framework this mod works under. However, if those emulators add Skyline support at some point in the future, then it may be possible for the training modpack to run on those platforms.
* Can I change the button combination to bring up the menu?
    * No, this is not currently supported. Use `SPECIAL+UPTAUNT` to open the menu.
* How do I fix the error message "The software has been closed due to an error" when starting Smash?
    * If you're on a Mac, check your SD card for files with dots at the beginning of them in the training mod files, they should be deleted (like, `._libtraining_modpack.nro` in addition to `libtraining_modpack.nro`).
* How do I fix the error message "Fatal error: Failed to stat stage2 (atmosphere/fusee-secondary.bin)"?
    * This is caused by improperly setting up the SD card. When adding files onto the SD card, make sure that you extract the contents of the .zip file first then add only the contents and not the parent folder onto the SD card! Consult the [Atmosphere documentation](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) for additional information.
* How do I remove the Training Mod?
    * It's as simple as removing the files associated with the modpack. Make sure you only remove the files that you wish to remove:
        * Skyline, the loader for code plugins like the modpack
        `atmosphere/contents/01006A800016E000/exefs/*`
        * Modpack plugins
            * `atmosphere/contents/01006A800016E000/romfs/libnn_hid_hook.nro`
            * `atmosphere/contents/01006A800016E000/romfs/libnro_hook.nro`
            * `atmosphere/contents/01006A800016E000/romfs/libtraining_modpack.nro`
        * Additional static files
            * `atmosphere/contents/01006A800016E000/manual_html/html-document/contents.htdocs/*`
            * `TrainingModpack/*` (which is generated by the modpack)
    * Make sure that you only remove the files that you don't want on your SD card anymore (e.g. don't remove skyline if you have other skyline plugins)
* What features are under development?
    * Check the [Projects Tab on Github](https://github.com/jugeeya/UltimateTrainingModpack/projects) and the Discord for the latest information on new development
* How do I contribute to the modpack?
    * Pull requests to the project repository are welcome for new features and bugfixes.

# Build from Source

If you'd like to build the modpack starting from the source code, you can build the NRO using the standard command for skyline plugins:

```bash
